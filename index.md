  This storyworld exists in the ancient Egyptian city of Giza where my version of the Great Pyramid of Giza (of the Pharaoh Khufu) still stands today. I built a large desert terrain on which the 3 pyramids stand, and I modified Kufu's pyramid so it has a big base at the bottom that is like a crypt where the dead bodies lie. I made one of the walls transparent so that the player is able to see the other 2 pyramids (Khafraa and Menkawraa) clearly while also being able to observe the numerous artifacts that I built within the crypt. These artifacts include a wall engraved with heiroglyphics, 3 pharaonic coffins that are lit from below, a golden treasure chest surrounded by gold coins, a statue of a queen kneeling on the ground, half the body of a pharaoh, and a huge scarab beetle engraving on one of the walls. This storyworld aims to spread cultural awareness about the iconic ancient Egyptian civilization through a fun and interesting virtual reality.
Reflect on your experience (use your progress reports for material)

  The project was not visible until the very end because the light could not be baked properly inside the pyramid Khufu, this is because the lightmap could not see the normals of the sides, so with the help of Professor Michael I flipped the normals and the pyramid was succesfully baked. The lighting give a feeling of suspense because it is lit from below with a tint of gold like it is in real life. Rather than just showcase how the real Khufu pyramid looks in real life, I created my own version which contains the most iconic pieces from different Pharaonic eras such as queen Hatshepsut kneeling, half of the Pharaoh anthropoid, and three mummies with different designs from different eras in the Egyptian civilization. The idea behind this change is to provide some sort of time traveling showcasing of the Egyptian civilization of the most significant figures, artistic styles, and iconic artifacts. The scarab is one of the most famous symbols of the culture and it had to be featured in this scene.
  
  I faced some difficulties in the beginning with regards to the graphics of my project where I initially created a terrain plane with too many pixels to generate, which caused my machine to almost stop work completely. I tried multiple numbers for the graining of the plane until I found the right balance, after which things became easier to handle. I found difficulty finding some essential assets on the Unity Asset Store alone, so I found alternatives such as TurboSquid (as suggested by Professor Michael), Free3D, SketchFab, Render Hub, etc. which enabled me to enhance the design of my world. Perfecting the tiling of materials was also a challenge that I learned to overcome through practice where by now I am able to guess the number of required x and y tilings for an image. I also faced some issues with baking the light where some objects were illuminated properly while others were not, but I reviewed the lighting lab and was able to resolve these issues. 
  Overall, like any first project with a new software, I was relatively slow in the beginning but eventually got the hang of Unity by time and can now create whole new worlds relatively efficiently without many technical difficulties. I really enjoyes environmental storytelling and I'm looking forward to integrating my knowledge in this aspect with character animation as well in the future.
